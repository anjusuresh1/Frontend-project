## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge project.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges allow us to improve our skills in a real-life workflow.

**To do this challenge, we need a basic understanding of HTML and CSS.**

## The challenge

The challenge was to build out this data storage component and get it looking as close to the given design as possible.

We can use any tools we like to  complete the challenge.

## Where to find everything

My task was to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design` folder. 

All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file, which contains the information such as color palette and fonts.
